<blockquote>
<p>There is more than one kind of freedom,&quot; said Aunt Lydia. &ldquo;Freedom to and freedom from. In the days of anarchy, it was freedom to. Now you are being given freedom from. Don&rsquo;t underrate it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A very multifaceted novel full of symbolism and allusions that managed to somehow confuse, entertain, amaze me all at the same time. Though I had previously heard of Margaret Atwood, it was my first time reading her writing. In this novel in particular, witty wording, puns, symbolism, dialogue only surrounded by quotation marks under very specific circumstances, and Offred&rsquo;s repeated references to the future readers of the story makes it feel almost like metafictional poetry. The episodic flip flops between Offred&rsquo;s life with Luke, life under control by Aunt Lydia, and present life make the story hard to follow at first, especially given that there is no visual or tonal distinction between these. This is obviously a purposeful choice though, and in my opinion it&rsquo;s really well done. Care is taken to introduce the republic of Gilead and the background of the story sufficiently, without overexplaining or resorting to info-dumps.</p>
<p>The republic of Gilead in the novel justifies it&rsquo;s actions with a biblical story from Genesis. In Genesis 30, Rachel, who is infertile, gives her servant Bilhah to Jacob to bear children for her. This is viewed as a positive light by proponents of the regime. However, we see that it later causes problems in the biblical story, such as Leah doing the same thing with her servant Zilpah out of jealousy sake, and also Reuben (Jacob&rsquo;s firstborn son) eventually committing adultery with Bilhah, thus losing his firstborn rights to a double inheritance. I presume that Reuben in the biblical story is analogous to Nick in <em>The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</em>, and also that the hanging of the three women during the salvaging chapter, a wive and two women on either side, is analogous to the crucifixion of Jesus.</p>
<p>The dystopia aspect of the novel is comparable to the one in Orwell&rsquo;s <em>1984</em>. In terms of plausibility, I find the situation in Orwell&rsquo;s novel to be more imaginable (though many would disagree). You could say the surveillance aspect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five%5FEyes">is</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global%5Fsurveillance%5Fdisclosures%5F(2013%E2%80%93present)">already</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%5FSnowden">happening</a> (or at least starting to happen). As for the manipulation of thought, that can, and already has, been done through changing the education systems, propaganda, use of terror, and other dictatorial techniques (I&rsquo;m sure you can think of historical examples). Once you take these into account, it&rsquo;s really not too absurd to envision a <em>1984</em>-like society in the future, especially if large amounts of power happen to reside within an elite few who happen to make use of these techniques. Compared to the Gilead in <em>The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</em>, which started from a suppression of the feminist movement and a coup d&rsquo;etat transforming the liberal United States into a dictatorship, the chances of a radical group like the &ldquo;Sons of Jacob&rdquo; in the novel succeeding and lasting are, at least in my view, less likely.</p>
<p>This is not to say it isn&rsquo;t possible, it certainly is with a large amount of following and luck (quoting from Margaret Atwood&rsquo;s forward to the book: &ldquo;Anything could happen anywhere, given the circumstances&rdquo;). Nor is it to say that Atwood&rsquo;s story doesn&rsquo;t have relevance in the political scenery, or that we shouldn&rsquo;t consider the imminent possibility of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12280617/">similar situations</a>. Perhaps we could treat it as &lsquo;A Modest Proposal&rsquo; (Swift) but for feminism. Or as a statement against religious theocracies in general.</p>

<p><span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">08/01/21</span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the messiest approach is the wisest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fundamental idea of this book is that in problem solving and decision making aspects, a group is smarter than the smartest person in them, given the right circumstances. This means that when wanting to make a accurate or good decision (because for some problems there are no &lsquo;accurate&rsquo; answers), it is preferable to go against conventional wisdom of asking only the experts and ask the crowd instead.</p>
<p>A couple prerequisites for a smart crowd from the book, plus some of my own speculations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diversity. A single individual only has a niche set of skills to solve problems when compared to the skillset of an entire crowd combined (assuming the crowd is diverse enough). Paradoxically, the more experts we add, the less diverse the crowd becomes, and thus the less intelligent. If we define expertise in a field as having a certain set of skills, these niche skills will be overemphasized if we have a crowd composed of only (or too many) experts. The opposite is also true. If we have too little experts, those skills that only they have will be lost.</li>
<li>Independence. The crowd ecosystem needs to have a balance of independence and coordination. Humans are quick to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%5Fcascade">imitate those around them</a>, which is fine if the idea they are imitating is intelligent, but this is too often not the case (eg: stock market bubbles). We can apply methods that force individual autonomy such anonymous voting, or really any system that allows individuals to make decisions simultaneously rather than one at a time (which eliminates the possibility of prior individual&rsquo;s decisions affecting latter ones), though this isn&rsquo;t practical in every case, like in markets for instance.</li>
<li>Decentralization paired with aggregation. Another problem with the oxymoron of a purely &lsquo;independent crowd&rsquo; is that many problems either require <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit%5Fknowledge">implicit knowledge</a> or knowledge that can be expressed but would take too much effort compared to the problem. Well coordinated decentralization solves this. There are many examples testifying to the success of decentralization across the board: ant colonies, beehives, bird flocks, peer-to-peer file transfer, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and the development of Linux. However, there are plenty of decentralized systems that have gone wrong, the book mentions traffic jams and the failure of the CIA to notice paramount clues that could have prevented the September 11 attacks, for instance. The book notes that successful decentralization is not a &ldquo;work on whatever you want as long as its related to the problem&rdquo; kind of scheme. View decentralization as a pool of information contributed by various individuals that could be, or could not be, useful to solve the problem. A good system needs a way to aggregate that information and pick out the ones that actually point to a solution, but without resorting to a top-down organizational structure where decision making power is centralized (because then it wouldn&rsquo;t be decentralization and you lose the wisdom the crowd can provide). There are a couple ways Surowiecki suggests:
<ul>
<li>Active communication between individual entities, which would allow them to share private knowledge and make it collective wisdom.</li>
<li>Dedicated systems to analyze information and incorporate it to solve problems. In Linux and other open source projects, anyone from the general public can submit source code patches, but they must be reviewed by people like Torvald&rsquo;s and some other high level developers before they get accepted into the next release. In the case of the CIA, Surowiecki suggests that (moral issues aside) either an internal, or better, public decision market that bets (motivated by real money rewards) on the likelihood of terrorist attacks could have been a good way to aggregate information. Of course, the downside to dedicated analysis is that it requires more work and money to implement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trust. Each individual in the collective group needs to trust that the rest will behave fairly. Otherwise, we will have a cascade of emotionally motivated irrational behaviour. The book cites the example that individuals who pay taxes presume that others are doing so as well. However, if they learn that everyone in their community is evading taxes, they are more likely to evade themselves, not because they don&rsquo;t believe in the importance of taxpaying, but purely because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum%5Fgame">others are not doing it</a>, because they believe it&rsquo;s unfair. Technically though, even if you evade (assuming you don&rsquo;t get into legal trouble for it), you still reap the benefits, like improved communities and the like. However, nobody will benefit if everyone evades. Therefore, if the majority of other individuals are paying taxes, it is logical to evade. So then why doesn&rsquo;t everyone evade? The answer is because they trust that the large majority of citizens will not evade, and they also trust that those who do will be punished. This trust is important to ensure cooperation.</li>

<p>I bet everyone has a side they don&rsquo;t show anyone else.</p>
<p>Kyouko Hori, Vol 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really enjoyed this manga, perhaps for it&rsquo;s constant visual variation, interesting romance and character development, or humour. Story-wise, the first couple volumes in particular were incredibly well structured, showing the evolving relationship between Miyamura and Hori and some snippets of flashbacks to Miyamura&rsquo;s middle school life and Hori&rsquo;s family situation, all interlaced in humorous romcom moments. Starting around volume 6, there was a stagnant phase where not much was happening, the plot wasn&rsquo;t advancing and neither was the character development. Personally, I think a slice of life type series need to make up for lack of action-based plot with character development. The romance development in the series in some ways feels similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden%5FTime%5F(novel%5Fseries)">Golden Time</a>, which I presume you would also enjoy if you liked Horimiya. The art in the series is great, the covers are very nice, and you can tell, as with many other long running manga, the artist&rsquo;s art improves over the course of the series.</p>
<p>The characters were a big reason I liked this series. Miyamura has piercings and tattoos, Hori is a cute girl that likes horror and is slightly sadistic, Yuki wears her sleeves over her hands all the time, Sengoku is so thin he wears seven shirts to pad himself up, Remi is an insect lover, Sawada is terrified of all guys but Miyamura, Iura is a ball of energy and enthusiasm, Yanagi has terrible eyes. You can imagine the humour of these characters put together, especially when the manga deals with the idea of internal and external self.</p>
<p>The ending of the story leaves a couple side romances unresolved: the situation with Yuki and Tooru, Sengoku&rsquo;s parent&rsquo;s opinion on him and Remi, Iura&rsquo;s sister and Kitahara, as well as Souta and Yuuna. Although this does leave a slightly empty feeling to the reader, I don&rsquo;t consider it to be too much of a problem because the main romance has already been settled, plus it gives room for some thought.</p>

<p>Even though the walls have been intact for the past 100 years, there’s nothing that can guarantee they won’t be broken down today.</p>
<p>Armin Arlert</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very hyped, action-packed, shounen series that just finished serializing. I was waiting for this series to finish before starting it. Because it was so hyped, I had high expectations coming in. Right away, I saw various similarities between it and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5FPromised%5FNeverland">Yakusoku no Neverland</a>, which I read last year. In fact, they are so similar I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they were directly based on each other.</p>

<p>To be honest, although I didn&rsquo;t hate the manga, I didn&rsquo;t particularly enjoy it either, at least compared to similar manga like <em>The Promised Neverland</em> and <em>Tokyo Ghoul</em>, or even compared to action-shounen manga with human-eating premises like <em>Demon Slayer</em>. I don&rsquo;t exactly know the reason, it wasn&rsquo;t like I didn&rsquo;t want to enjoy it (or more accurately I wanted to want to enjoy it). I think that it is overhyped for the quality that it is, but I feel insecure with saying that. After all, it&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack%5Fon%5FTitan#Reception">won numerous major awards and the first volume was on the New York Times Manga Best Seller list for 81 straight weeks</a>, so I don&rsquo;t want to discredit it as a &lsquo;bad series&rsquo; when obviously it&rsquo;s status and ranking says otherwise.</p>
