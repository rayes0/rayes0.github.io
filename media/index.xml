      <description>Thoughts, reviews, and summaries on things I&#39;ve finished since August 2021. Books Fiction The Handmaid&amp;rsquo;s Tale 08/04/21
A fairly multifaceted novel full of symbolism and allusions that managed to somehow confuse, entertain, amaze me all at the same time. Though I had previously heard of Margaret Atwood, it was my first time reading her writing. In this novel in particular, witty wording, puns, symbolism, most dialogue not being surrounded by quotation marks, and Offred&amp;rsquo;s repeated references to the future readers of the story makes it feel almost like metafictional poetry.</description>
