      <description>ⓘ Note   This was a term paper originally written for my high school English course. I was proud how it turned out, so I decided to refactor some paragraphs and add headings, and republished it here.

In this post, I want to share some thoughts about Hotarou and about his persona, which seems fairly common among individuals today, especially teens around Hotarou&amp;rsquo;s age.</description>
