If I were to describe this show, I would say it has the dewy, light but slow pacing of Shinkai&amp;rsquo;s The Garden of Words with the character design and general air similar to that of A Silent Voice (which is understandable given the sizable proportion of staff shared between A Silent Voice and this movie), slapped with a unsaturated, watercolour-like palette.</description></item><item><title>A Search for the Best Spaced Learning Algorithm</title><link>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/spaced-repetition/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/spaced-repetition/</guid><description>Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique which utilizes the spacing effect. In contrast to more traditional repetition-based learning strategies such as cramming in which the main focus is on the total number of repetitions, spaced repetition is timing-based and focuses on maximizing efficiency by doing repetitions at scheduled times (typically decided by the difficulty of the material). Numerous studies have been conducted on spaced repetition (and on memory in general), and there is strong evidence suggesting that spaced repetition decreases the number of needed repetitions, and improves retention significantly over the long term.</description></item><item><title>Psychoanalysis of 'Slow Cold Chick'</title><link>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/slow-cold-chick/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 09:56:01 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/slow-cold-chick/</guid><description>â“˜ Note This was a term paper originally written for my high school English course. I was fairly pleased with how it turned out, so I decided to refactor some paragraphs and add headings, and republish it here. Abstract Psychoanalysis, or at least the traditional version proposed by Sigmund Freud, is viewed by many modern psychologists as a highly controversial, sexist &amp;ldquo;pseudoscience&amp;rdquo; (1). There are many reasons for this, including dubious, untestable ideas, unethicality of some of the claims, and lack of scientific support, all of which are quite justified (2).</description></item><item><title>Why Artificial Consciousness may be possible</title><link>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/consciousness/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jun 2021 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/consciousness/</guid><description>It is commonly accepted that machines cannot be conscious, and that any perceived consciousness is merely an imitation of organic consciousness. While I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree with these claims, there is not much solid proof for them, though of course, the same is true for the converse. However, it is still worth considering both sides of the problem. Therefore, for arguments sake, this article will lay out a series of examples and thought experiments potentially showing that artificial conscious could be possible.</description></item><item><title>*Hyouka*: My Thoughts</title><link>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/hyouka/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2021 16:45:09 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/hyouka/</guid><description>Meta-collection of loosely chronologically ordered miscellaneous thoughts on the Classic Literature Club light novel series by Honobu Yonezawa, compiled slowly bit by bit over many weeks as I reread all 6 volumes and rewatch all 22 episodes. The series showcases Oreki Houtarou, a high school boy and zealous energy conservationist. Starting with his first day of high school, it follows him as he experiences new situations challenging his previous way of life.</description></item></channel></rss>
