Sound Throughout many scenes in the movie, the steps of the girls are accompanied by a satisfying tap sound (which Yamada the director said was sampled from actual real life sounds). These steps are aligned to the BPM of the underlying track.</description></item><item><title>A Search for the Best Spaced Learning Algorithm</title><link>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/spaced-repetition/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/spaced-repetition/</guid><description>Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique which utilizes the spacing effect. In contrast to more traditional repetition-based learning strategies such as cramming in which the main focus is on the total number of repetitions, spaced repetition is timing-based and focuses on maximizing efficiency by doing repetitions at scheduled times (typically decided by the difficulty of the material). Numerous studies have been conducted on spaced repetition (and on memory in general), and there is strong evidence suggesting that spaced repetition decreases the number of needed repetitions, and improves retention significantly over the long term.</description></item><item><title>Psychoanalysis of 'Slow Cold Chick'</title><link>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/slow-cold-chick/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 09:56:01 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/slow-cold-chick/</guid><description>â“˜ Note This was a term paper originally written for my high school English course. I was fairly pleased with how it turned out, so I decided to refactor some paragraphs and add headings, and republish it here. Abstract Psychoanalysis, or at least the traditional version proposed by Sigmund Freud, is viewed by many modern psychologists as a highly controversial, sexist &amp;ldquo;pseudoscience&amp;rdquo; (1). There are many reasons for this, including dubious, untestable ideas, unethicality of some of the claims, and lack of scientific support, all of which are quite justified (2).</description></item><item><title>Why Artificial Consciousness may be possible</title><link>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/consciousness/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jun 2021 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/consciousness/</guid><description>It is commonly accepted that machines cannot be conscious, and that any perceived consciousness is merely an imitation of organic consciousness. While I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree with these claims, there is not much solid proof for them, though of course, the same is true for the converse. However, it is still worth considering both sides of the problem. Therefore, for arguments sake, this article will lay out a series of examples and thought experiments potentially showing that artificial conscious could be possible.</description></item><item><title>*Hyouka*: The Aesthetics of Roses and Rain</title><link>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/hyouka/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2021 16:45:09 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/hyouka/</guid><description>Hyouka is an unexpectedly subtle story at the intersection of mystery, comedy, and romance. This is a collection of loosely chronologically ordered miscellaneous thoughts on the Classic Literature Club light novel series by Honobu Yonezawa, compiled slowly bit by bit over many weeks as I reread all 6 volumes and rewatch all 22 episodes.
Synopsis For those not in the loop, the basic premise of the series goes something like this: A boy by the name Oreki Houtarou is impelled to join the Classics Club of his high school by his sister, currently travelling in India.</description></item></channel></rss>
