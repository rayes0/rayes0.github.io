If I were to describe this show, I would say it has the dewy, light but slow pacing of Shinkai&amp;rsquo;s The Garden of Words with the character design and general air similar to that of A Silent Voice (which is understandable given the sizable proportion of staff shared between A Silent Voice and this movie), slapped with a unsaturated, watercolour-like palette.</description></item><item><title>*Hyouka*: My Thoughts</title><link>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/hyouka/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2021 16:45:09 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://rayes0.github.io/blog/hyouka/</guid><description>Meta-collection of loosely chronologically ordered miscellaneous thoughts on the Classic Literature Club light novel series by Honobu Yonezawa, compiled slowly bit by bit over many weeks as I reread all 6 volumes and rewatch all 22 episodes.
