It&rsquo;s not my actual name, just a pseudonym. I&rsquo;m a FOSS supporter, Linux enthusiast, musician, and writer. I am fascinated particularly by the brain, memory, neurobiology, and psychology.</p><h2 id=hobbies><a href=#hobbies class=hlink>Hobbies</a></h2><p>I have a fair amount of hobbies that I try to consistently do. They are fairly niche and a lot of them are uncommon, but I enjoy spending time on them, otherwise I would have dropped them already.</p><h3 id=music><a href=#music class=hlink>Music</a></h3><p>I like to play and make music. I was classically trained as a pianist when I was in junior high. However, I consider myself self-taught as I feel I improved dramatically more as a result of my own practice compared to studying with a teacher. Age and maturity was probably a large factor for this, as well as the fact that when I had a teacher, I was too young to really appreciate music.</p><p>I have experience teaching students (mostly elementary aged children) piano and theory. I have taught students up to RCM level 8.</p><p>I create electronic music (mainly lofi hip hop) occasionally for fun, and to test out Linux capabilities in the professional audio scene. You may have seen me active in <a href=https://youtube.com/unfa000>unfa&rsquo;s</a> Discord server, or seen my tracks featured on the <a href=https://www.zrythm.org/>Zrythm</a> website.</p><h3 id=badminton><a href=#badminton class=hlink>Badminton</a></h3><p>I play competitive badminton for fun and exercise. I used to compete actively and even participated in a few national level tournaments. Previously, I was really serious about getting better, but I don&rsquo;t really think that way so much anymore, preferring instead to have fun promoting and playing a great sport. I am an coach at my club and have a fair amount of experience coaching elementary and junior high aged children.</p><p>I also do other forms of exercise regularly. These include road biking (I try to do at least 45 km/week, a very measly amount compared to what some others do), rollerblading, and more recently, skateboarding (still trying to get better, I can currently only ollie and do some other very basic tricks).</p><h3 id=writing><a href=#writing class=hlink>Writing</a></h3><p>Nowadays, noone really cares about text based blogging anymore. Nonetheless, I sometimes like to write on this blog. The content on this site is composed of thoughts and research on the broad array of niche topics I&rsquo;m interested in. In particular, psychology, neuroscience, statistics, machine learning, biotech, sound design, and anime/manga, or some weird combination of these. Not for profit, self-promotion, I don&rsquo;t really care how many readers I get. It&rsquo;s mainly a dump for my thoughts and ideas that would otherwise just be wasted sitting in my head.</p><p>In the past, I&rsquo;ve tried writing fiction in the form of a webnovel titled <a href=/anemoia>anemoia</a>, which I eventually stopped updating because there aren&rsquo;t enough hours in a day. It was an enjoyable experience though, and I would love to pick it up again sometime in the future. Note that I haven&rsquo;t really edited it and only did the first couple chapters on a whim, and I consider it a <em>very</em> rough draft.</p><p>My writings should probably be taken with a grain of salt. They are sometimes heavily opinionated, and though I do read a fairly large number of papers, articles, and books (or at least, I like to think I do), I often don&rsquo;t have formal education in any of the fields I write about.</p><h3 id=coding-and-linux><a href=#coding-and-linux class=hlink>Coding and Linux</a></h3><p>I occasionally code as a hobby. I only started doing it recently, and haven&rsquo;t taken it too seriously, it&rsquo;s mainly just for fun. I am particularly interested in data processing, ML and AI, and UI development. I&rsquo;ve contributed to various open source projects in small amounts, good examples include Emacs and XMonad. I write a fair number of scripts on a near daily basis for when I want to automate pretty much any arduous task like renaming files, scraping websites, etc. I&rsquo;m also a Linux enthusiast and am fairly active in the <a href=https://reddit.com/r/unixporn>unixporn</a> community.</p><p>Languages/skills I consider myself proficient with:</p><ul><li>Rust</li><li>Python</li><li>Bash and POSIX shell script</li><li>Front-end web development: HTML5, CSS, JS</li><li>Scientific computing: R, GNU Octave/Matlab, GNUPlot</li><li>All major operating systems, especially Red Hat-based Linux distributions</li></ul><h3 id=media><a href=#media class=hlink>Media</a></h3><p>I like Japanese anime and manga, as well as their Chinese and Korean equivalents. I prefer to read over watch, so I yearn towards manga and light novels more than anime. I am reasonably fluent in Chinese because I speak it with my parents (though not at the level of a native speaker yet), and am currently learning Japanese. I hope to move on the Korean when I am more versed in these two.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t game very often, in fact hardly at all nowadays. Games never piqued my interest very heavily. I occasionally read visual novels sometimes, if you want to count them as games.</p><p>I also read a fair share of English literature. Some of my favourites include Atwood&rsquo;s <em>The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</em> and Saint-Exupery&rsquo;s <em>The Little Prince</em>.</p><p>I have a <a href=/media>regularly updated list</a> of thoughts and reviews on books, manga, and anime I have finished.</p><h3 id=misc><a href=#misc class=hlink>Misc</a></h3><h4 id=speedcubing><a href=#speedcubing class=hlink>Speedcubing</a></h4><figure><a href=/img/about/speedcubes.jpg><img src=/img/about/speedcubes.jpg alt="A subset of my humble speedcube collection"></a><figcaption><h4>A subset of my humble speedcube collection</h4></figcaption></figure><p>I <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing>speedcube</a>. I used to go to competitions, but I don&rsquo;t compete much anymore. Speedcubing is definitely a niche hobby and does require you to spend a decent chunk of time practising and memorizing algorithms. It is incredibly rewarding hitting a solve with a personal best on the timer though.</p><h4 id=gardening><a href=#gardening class=hlink>Gardening</a></h4><figure><a href=/img/about/greenhouse.jpg><img src=/img/about/greenhouse.jpg alt="Inside the greenhouse"></a><figcaption><h4>Inside the greenhouse</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><a href=/img/about/greenhouse-outside.jpg><img src=/img/about/greenhouse-outside.jpg alt="Outside the greenhouse"></a><figcaption><h4>Outside the greenhouse</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Gardening is a massive stress-relieving pastime, though it takes a large amount of dedication and effort if you want to do it well. My parents own a greenhouse (which my dad and I built), as well as some outdoor plants which I take care of. Sometimes it feels like a waste of effort, but I suppose there are much worse ways I could be using my time. And of course, the subsequent payoff of beautiful plants and organic food makes it feel worth it.</p><h2 id=things-i-use><a href=#things-i-use class=hlink>Things I use</a></h2><ul><li><p>Pen and paper:</p><ul><li><strong>Fountain pens:</strong> Lamy Safari for day to day use, a Pilot Metropolitan when I&rsquo;m feeling fancy. I use EF sized nibs because my writing is tiny. For ink, I use a bottle of Sheaffer plain black ink. Nothing fancy.</li><li><strong>Journals:</strong> I use classic Leuchtturm 1917 A5 notebooks with blank pages. I journal according to my mood. Sometimes it&rsquo;s bullet journaling, sometimes it&rsquo;s long form, sometimes it&rsquo;s poetry. I don&rsquo;t sketch or draw though, I&rsquo;ve tried to get into it numerous times before but always ended up dropping it after a while.</li></ul></li><li><p>Hardware:</p><ul><li><strong>Main laptop/workstation:</strong> Thinkpad P1 Gen 3</li><li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> Custom handwired 60% layout with trackpoint I took from an old Thinkpad, OLED screen, and a rotary encoder. Hako Violet switches. Running QMK firmware on WeAct Studio&rsquo;s Black Pill MCU.</li></ul></li><li><p>Software:</p><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Fedora Linux. Latest stable release.</li><li><strong>Window manager:</strong> XMonad</li><li><strong>Text editor:</strong> Emacs (built from master branch using <code>--with-json --with-native-compilation --with-x-toolkit=lucid --with-xinput2</code>) with default bindings.</li><li><strong>Note-taking:</strong> Org mode</li><li><strong>Planner:</strong> Org agenda</li><li><strong>Terminal and shell commands:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been spending less and less time in the shell as most shell commands have been replaced by Emacs components. For example, I basically never use file management commands like <code>mv</code>, <code>cp</code>, <code>ls</code>, etc. outside of scripting, instead replacing them with dired. I don&rsquo;t even have a terminal emulator installed anymore (though I previously used rxvt-unicode). Emacs <code>shell-command</code> and <code>async-shell-command</code> probably covers ~90% of shell commands I need to run. If I need an interactive shell, I use eshell. If in the very rare case that I need full fledged terminal capabilities, I use <a href=https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm>vterm</a>, and in an even rarer case where my Emacs daemon has crashed (though it hardly ever crashes unless I open too many buffers and trigger the kernel OOM killer), I have emacs running through a systemd service set to restart on failure, so it just restarts :p.</li><li><strong>Browser:</strong> Tor Browser with JS and cookies blocked for casual browsing, Ungoogled-chromium for school and professional related browsing.</li><li><strong>PDF&rsquo;s:</strong> Emacs <a href=https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools>pdf-tools</a></li><li><strong>Ebooks (epubs, mobis, djvu, cbz, etc.):</strong> I transfer them to my jailbroken Kindle PW and read them there with <a href=https://github.com/koreader/koreader>KOReader</a></li><li><strong>Video player (mostly youtube, sometimes anime):</strong> mpv</li><li><strong>Other applications I use daily:</strong> Anki (flashcards), Calibre (ebook library)</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=contact><a href=#contact class=hlink>Contact</a></h2><ul><li>Email - <code>mailj2@protonmail.com</code></li><li>Matrix - Available on request. This is my current preferred way to communicate.</li><li>Discord - Available on request (I try to limit my use of proprietary services, so I would prefer you contact me with one of the above first)</li></ul><h1 id=this-site><a href=#this-site class=hlink>This Site</a></h1><p>This site used to use a moderately flashy <a href=https://github.com/rayes0/hugo-theme-sayo>old theme</a> I forked, and was filled with a couple short, opinionated, and conspicuously amateur posts. Eventually, I got bored of posting and the blog fell stagnant for a while. One day, I felt motivated enough to revamp the theme to what you are seeing now, and also decided to revamp my writings (not much has changed though, I still consider my posts amateur).</p><p>The content on this site will vary from post to post. I don&rsquo;t consider my posts traditional blog posts, most of them are lengthy and are I intend to edit them over the long term. Calling them essays probably makes more sense. Unless otherwise noted, all content is licensed under <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0</a>. You can look at the <a href=/categories/>categories page</a> for the main subject areas. There&rsquo;s also a <a href=/tags>tags page</a> that contains smaller subtopics. For each post, I will sort it into one category that represents the primary focus topic, and add an assortment of tags for other subjects referenced. I will also almost always modify posts after I initially publish them, sometimes small edits like adding a piece of support or referencing a cool source I find, or sometimes adding whole paragraphs or refactoring the post entirely.</p><p>The posts of the site are written in Emacs and compiled from <a href=https://orgmode.org/>Org mode</a> → Markdown using <a href=https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/>ox-hugo</a>, then from Markdown → HTML using <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. You may question why I don&rsquo;t just write in Markdown and build the site with Hugo directly in one step, compared to generating BlackFriday markdown first from Org mode. Due to the nature of this site (managing fairly long writings over the long term), it requires a good way to manage information. Org mode to me is unparalleled to Markdown in this respect. Skim the <a href=https://orgmode.org/manual/>Table of Contents of the Org manual</a> to get a general idea why. It also requires a strong and stable templating system, capable of handling complex logic with lists of content and iteration. I&rsquo;ve yet to come across a static site generator with as powerful a templating system as Hugo (hate me or love me for it). It also needs to be lightweight enough to build long content quickly and ideally good for running on CI. Hugo ticks these boxes. You might also ask why I don&rsquo;t just generate HTML directly from Org mode markup. This is probably fine for simple pages I could, but it&rsquo;ll be an uphill battle. I&rsquo;d have to write many custom filter functions, and I&rsquo;ll probably get frustrated along the way and just end up writing a whole new ox export backend. All for a niche product that probably only works on my specific site. Not that I&rsquo;m opposed to the idea, just that I don&rsquo;t have the time or energy to undertake a project like that as of now.</p><p>The design of this site is based on a variety of sources. CSS libraries like <a href=https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css>Tufte CSS</a> and <a href=https://github.com/vincentdoerig/latex-css>LaTeX.css</a> played a predominant role. The theme is written in HTML and SCSS only (no JS). This is mainly because this site is primarily text-based and I didn&rsquo;t want to focus too much on the theme. Plus a lot of privacy centric users have JS disabled most of the time anyway. The font used is <a href=https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book>ET-Book</a>, a very nice bembo-style font used by the famous Edward Tufte. If your browser doesn&rsquo;t allow remote fonts, it will fall back to other common serif fonts before using your system generic one.</p><p><img src=/ltximg/blog_dd32a4291e89496587229b52ca8a1e271b4ff2ff.svg alt=$\LaTeX$ class=org-svg> rendering is done without JS by using static SVG images created using <code>dvisvgm</code>. The most prominent advantage to this is I am not limited by the feature set supported by eg, MathJax or <img src=/ltximg/blog_2ad21b4ed7a4eb23a4b21293cd91f04f283cf5e3.svg alt="$K\kern-.25em\raisebox{.45ex}{\scriptsize A}\kern-.15em\TeX$" class=org-svg>. In particular, I can generate images using any TeX package installed on my system. We don&rsquo;t require JS as well. The disadvantages are that we lose responsiveness (which shouldn&rsquo;t be too much of an issue, I don&rsquo;t have long paragraphs of math anyways), some browsers don&rsquo;t support or disable SVG rendering for security reasons (Tor Browser is a notable example), and SVGs look bad on Firefox for a multitude of reasons (at least currently).</p><p>Some possible features I would like to implement in the future, while still being usable without JS:</p><ul><li>Sidenotes instead of footnotes would make references and extra content easy to view. Maybe something like <a href=https://danilafe.com/blog/sidenotes/>this</a>.</li></ul><h2 id=post-metadata><a href=#post-metadata class=hlink>Post Metadata</a></h2><ul><li>An explanation of the metadata at the top of each post:<ul><li><strong>1st field:</strong> Main category of the page.</li><li><strong>Created:</strong> Date the page was created.</li><li><strong>Modified:</strong> The last modified date. This is automatically created by looking at either the Git revision log or the Hugo front matter in the file.</li><li><strong>Status:</strong> The status of the post indicating how complete I feel it currently is. The following keywords are used:<ul><li>&lsquo;inprogress&rsquo; - An incomplete post that is still being actively added to.</li><li>&lsquo;draft&rsquo; - A post that has most large sections and ideas laid out, but I am still working on some details.</li><li>&lsquo;completed&rsquo; - A post I am mostly done with. There may be a few small changes like grammer and wording and such, but I most likely won&rsquo;t make any large changes.</li></ul></li><li><strong>2nd line:</strong> List of tags. This is a list of topics which are referenced by the post, or which the post loosely falls into.</li></ul></li></ul></article></div></div><footer><div class=container><p class=credits><a href=https://rayes0.github.io/blog/index.xml>rss</a>
